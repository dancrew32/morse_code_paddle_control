# Use your Morse Code / CW Paddles to control your computer with a VBand USB Paddle Adapter

CW/Morse Code 2-paddle keyer controlling keyboard input (tested on windows)

Have you ever wanted to control your computer with your CW/Morse Code Paddle Keyer?!

No? Just me? Okay.

Welp this is how it works:

* https://hamradio.solutions/vband/ get a VBand USB adapter or build your own with an arduino
* Hook it up to your windows machine - I'll get it to work on osx/ubuntu later - promise!
* `virtualenv venv`
* `.\venv\Scripts\python.exe .\main.py` (windows)
* focus a notepad and start typing
* https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimium-ff/ Try vimium to browse the web, paddling `f` to bring up quick-jump, then just paddle the two letters, and voila you have clicked a link or something!
